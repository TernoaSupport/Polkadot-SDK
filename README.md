# Nominator.js
Get the total count of nominators + bonded stake for each Validators using Polkadot API.
TotalbondedCaps is not fully accurate, it doens't take into account the unbond period of 28 days.
A solution would be to take the bonded CAPS from the last eras.stakers, but lazy to make it now ...
